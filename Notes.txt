first initialise the project -> npm init
then install express for the project -> npm i express

install nodemon -> npm i nodemon
run it -> npx nodemon js_file.js (js filename)

nodemon is a shortcut to run server if there are lot of changes in js file
You dont need to ctrl+C to terminate and run node js_file.js again and again
Instead use nodemon
